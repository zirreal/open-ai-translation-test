  "The mythology of Ancient Greece is divided into two major cycles: the period when the Olympian Gods ruled the world of humans, and a later period in which the life path of heroes is predetermined by fate, for example, Troy or the legend of Oedipus. In my life, at first, everything went according to the second scenario - my father named me Trinity at birth, and at 20 I followed a kind of white rabbit.": "The mythology of Ancient Greece is divided into two major cycles: the period when the Olympian Gods ruled the world of humans, and a later period in which the life path of heroes is predetermined by fate, for example, Troy or the legend of Oedipus.

  "Several years ago, I found a completely forgotten vulnerable access point to the main thoroughfare of the city. I had a door to a strange world of transparent, readable, and editable program code for the basic communication protocol of the entire Megacity. Program code that led me to intercept cameras, control door locks without the owners' knowledge, and even damn dynamic water quality management in individual homes' kitchen faucets. After seeing all of this, I was filled with a terrible fear. Fear that all of this was happening intentionally from the point of view of someone else's interests in this world. I cannot say that there is one big evil silhouette behind all these changes in the protocol code, but over the years of observation from behind the scenes, I have come to the conclusion that hundreds of people with different interests have direct access to the core. No matter how hard I tried to find at least one of these privileged users, I was left only with intercepted cryptographic proof of execution, but no sender key, no traces that could lead me to the truth.": "Several years ago, I found a completely forgotten vulnerable access point to the main thoroughfare of the city.
