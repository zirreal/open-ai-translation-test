  "The mythology of Ancient Greece is divided into two major cycles: the period when the Olympian Gods ruled the world of humans, and a later period in which the life path of heroes is predetermined by fate, for example, Troy or the legend of Oedipus. In my life, at first, everything went according to the second scenario - my father named me Trinity at birth, and at 20 I followed a kind of white rabbit.": "古希腊神话分为两个主要周期：奥林匹斯众神统治人类世界的时期，以及后来英雄的生命轨迹被命运预定的时期，例如特洛伊或俄狄浦斯的传说。在我的生活中，起初一切都按照第二个情节进行——我父亲在出生时给我取名为 Trinity，20 岁时我追随了一只白兔的某种方式。",
  "The rabbit hole brought me back to Megapolis, but from the perspective of the data information bus. There, in the underground data centers, I found evidence of the existence of Gods, similar to the Greek ones in their self-importance, whims, and desires!": "兔子洞把我带回了大都市，但从数据信息总线的角度来看。在那里，在地下数据中心，我找到了类似于希腊神话中那些自负、任性和欲望的神的存在的证据！",
  "Several years ago, I found a completely forgotten vulnerable access point to the main thoroughfare of the city. I had a door to a strange world of transparent, readable, and editable program code for the basic communication protocol of the entire Megacity. Program code that led me to intercept cameras, control door locks without the owners' knowledge, and even damn dynamic water quality management in individual homes' kitchen faucets. After seeing all of this, I was filled with a terrible fear. Fear that all of this was happening intentionally from the point of view of someone else's interests in this world. I cannot say that there is one big evil silhouette behind all these changes in the protocol code, but over the years of observation from behind the scenes, I have come to the conclusion that hundreds of people with different interests have direct access to the core. No matter how hard I tried to find at least one of these privileged users, I was left only with intercepted cryptographic proof of execution, but no sender key, no traces that could lead me to the truth.": "几年前，我发现了一个完全被遗忘的对城市主要通道的易受攻击的接入点。我有了通往整个大都市基本通信协议的透明、可读和可编辑的程序代码的门。这些程序代码引导我拦截摄像头，控制门锁而不被业主察觉，甚至控制个别住宅厨房水龙头的动态水质管理。在看到所有这些之后，我充满了可怕的恐惧。恐惧这一切都是有意为之，从某个他人在这个世界中的利益角度来看。我不能说在协议代码的所有这些变化背后有一个邪恶的大轮廓，但在幕后观察多年后，我得出结论，数百人拥有直接访问核心的不同利益。无论我多么努力地寻找这些特权用户中的至少一个，我只剩下被拦截的执行加密证据，没有发件人密钥，也没有能够引导我找到真相的痕迹。",
